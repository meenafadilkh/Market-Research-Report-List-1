<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anesthesia Breathing Circuits Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Rebreathing Circuits</li><li>Rebreathing Circuits</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The anesthesia breathing circuits market is primarily divided into two types: non-rebreathing circuits and rebreathing circuits. Non-rebreathing circuits allow exhaled gas to exit without returning to the patient, minimizing carbon dioxide buildup and enhancing oxygen delivery, ideal for procedures requiring strict control of inhaled gases. Conversely, rebreathing circuits enable the patient to inhale a mixture of fresh and exhaled gases, promoting gas conservation and efficient ventilation, making them suitable for longer surgeries and reducing waste in controlled environments.</p></p>
