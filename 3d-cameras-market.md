<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The 3D Cameras Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Stereo Vision</li><li>Time of Flight</li><li>Structured Light</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The 3D cameras market is primarily categorized into three types: Stereo Vision, Time of Flight (ToF), and Structured Light. Stereo Vision utilizes two lenses to capture depth information by analyzing images from different angles. Time of Flight cameras measure the time it takes for light to travel to an object and back, providing accurate depth data. Structured Light projects a known pattern onto a scene, and the deformation of this pattern helps calculate the 3D shape of objects, making each type suitable for various applications such as gaming, robotics, and industrial automation.</p></p>
